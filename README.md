# Disclaimer
I am not a professional. I am a high school student. As such, you probably shouldn't use this for anything that could possibly cause harm if something were to go awry. I strongly suggest using a more properly documented, tested, and professionally made library rather than this one if you're planning to do anything of significant importance. I do not take responsibility for any harm that may come from the use of this library.
